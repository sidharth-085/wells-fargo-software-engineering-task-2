# Wells Fargo Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program Forage

ðŸš€ Embarking on the Wells Fargo Software Engineering Virtual Experience Journey! ðŸš€

**Task 1: Crafting a Data Model ðŸŽ¨**
In the first phase, I delved into designing an innovative data model for an investment management system. Focused on efficient data representation and seamless interrelationships, this challenge deepened my expertise in data architecture.

**Task 2: Breathing Life with JPA ðŸ’»**
Transitioning to the hands-on phase, I brought the meticulously designed data model to life using the Java Persistence API (JPA). This practical exercise propelled me into the realm of software engineering, cultivating a real-world understanding beyond mere lines of code.

ðŸŒŸ Upwards and onwards, to the horizon of endless possibilities! ðŸŒŸ
